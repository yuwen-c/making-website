## position

- default: static.

## fixed, sticky
- fixed:   
when the page rolling down, the element stay at the same position of the "screen".
- sticky:   
the element has his original position, when rolling down, it sticks to our CSS position and stay there.
- these two are used for advertisment.

## relative, absolute
- relative: to move the element based on the original position 
- absolute: to define the position based on the screen 

## interaction
- if an ABSOLUTE element is not inside any other elements, the position is based on the window.
- if an ABSOLUTE element is inside the other element,   
  - the outter element is STATIC (default position), then nothing will happen.
  - the outter element is ABSOLUTE or RELATIVE, then the position of inner element is based on the outter element.
