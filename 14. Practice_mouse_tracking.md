## Mouse Tracking

1. set a ball to present the mouse, a ball with three layers halo.

2. set an event that listen to the movement of mouse:
```
document.addevent.addEventListener("mousemove",(object)=>{
})
```
- "mousemove": to whom your are listening
- (object): execute function when receive the subject movements. function name is omitted, return a parameter.

```
        document.addEventListener("mousemove", (what) => {
            console.log(what.clientX, what.clientY);
            resultX = what.clientX;
            resultY = what.clientY;
        })
```
- then pass the clientX, Y to another variable

3. CSS: set #ball:
```
#ball{
transform:translate(x,y);
}
```
- and var(--X), var(--y)

or:
```
            top: var(--mouseY);
            left: var(--mouseX);
```

4. then set a function to connect --mouseX to JS.

5. use this method to set animation:
requestAnimationFrame(setMovement)

6. set the ball position and mouse position seperately.
set another variable: distance, to get the distance of this two things.

7. think of this: we would like to let the ball chasing the mouse but not that fast.
so, the new ball position = the old position + an amount of distance.

8. set halos:
halo div are actually three layers that share the same center of mind with the ball,
but they have differente radius.
so we set radius with an variable "--scale" to each halo.
